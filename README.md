 Designing Low-Level I/O procedures
 
An Assembly program using macros where the user inputs 10 signed decimal integers that are small enough to fit into a 32 bit register.
After numbers are entered, they are converted from ASCII to their numeric representation in order to validate then they are converted
back to ASCII in order to display a list of numbers, as well as the sum and average of the numbers.
